    <li>Energy Management System
      <ul>
        <li>The project has two major modules Remote Energy Monitoring(REM) and Bill Management System(BMS). I work on REM module.</li>
        <li>REM module is responsible for data capturing and analysis to help the client understand their energy needs and manage them.</li>
        <li>I work on various dashboards and reports to showcase the energy profile of various parameters e.g. electricity consumption, gas consumption, temperature, etc. to the client.</li>

    <li>Detection of Multiple Traffic Signals in an Image Using Convolutional Neural Networks on MATLAB
      <ul>
        <li>In this research project a transfer learning approach is used. At first the network is trained on
          CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of 50000 training images to classify objects. The network is
          implemented using various number of hidden layers and accuracy of classification is recorded.</li>
        <li>After that the network is trained again on a comparatively smaller dataset consisting of 200 images
          containing five traffic signs to detect these traffic signs in test images.

    <li>Industrial Automation System
      <ul>
        <li>This system consists of a Robotic arm which is controlled by AVR (Atmega16) microcontroller. The
          robotic arm is equipped with a gripper and driller attached to its end-effector.</li>
        <li>The system consists of a conveyor belt mechanism also. This mechanism is controlled by PLC
          (Allen-Bradley Micrologix 1000). This system sorts objects on the basis of their size and their
          metallic character.
